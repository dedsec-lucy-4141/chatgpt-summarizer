This Extension works on check GPT so for that you need to include this extension in your chrome and then. You need to login into your chat GPT account, that is openAI account and if not if you don't want to login you can also pass the API key of your check GPT.
By right-clicking on the icon then going to the option and then pasting it to the API key and from there it will take your API and it will run on that.
